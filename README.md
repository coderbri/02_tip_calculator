# 02 Tip Calculator

This is the **Day 2 Challenge** from Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp. This project demonstrates the following skills:
- Primitive data types
- Type conversion
- Performing basic mathematical operations
- Number manipulation and rounding
- Using f-strings for formatted output

## Project Description

The **Tip Calculator** project is a Python script designed to calculate how much each person should contribute when splitting a bill. The user inputs the total bill, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. The script then computes the total amount per person, rounded to two decimal places.



## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input:
   - The total bill amount
   - The percentage tip they want to give (e.g., 10%, 12%, or 15%)
   - The number of people splitting the bill
2. The script calculates the total bill with the tip included and divides it by the number of people.
3. The result is rounded to two decimal places and displayed.

For example:
```python
total_bill = 150
tip = 12 / 100     # 0.12
total_bill = 150 * 1.12  # 150 + 18 = 168
total_per_person = 168 / 5  # 33.60
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the script with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
